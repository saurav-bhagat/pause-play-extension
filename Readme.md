# Pause-Play Extension

A chrome extension which let you easily swtich between your course tab(udemy, coursera..) and entertainment tab (youtube, spotify..). No need to manually click *pause* and *play* while switching tabs
in between a course.

It's still in development phase. You can contribute here : [issues](https://github.com/saurav-bhagat/pause-play-extension/issues)
